# Express API Project

Using data of our choice (I used 2020 formula one results from ergast) this API has a number of different endpoints to retrieve the data.

## The problem

I started by thinking about the data that I thought would be useful to see, and what would be the easiest ways to manipulate the data based on its preexisting shape. I then made some compomises so that I could use as much of my time on creating a number of endpoints rather than only changing the shape of the data.
